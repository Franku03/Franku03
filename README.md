## 👋 Hi there, I'm Franklin Quintana (AKA Franku overhere)

I'm an Informatics Engineering student at Universidad Católica Andrés Bello (UCAB), just at the end of my career. I really love to learn and test new ideas with any kind of programming technology (languages, databases, frameworks, cloud services, containers), always in search of improving my programming skills but also my logic reasoning and design thinking, alongside people from whom I can share and learn any kind of knowledge or experience.

I have lot of interest in web and mobile development, both frontend and backend, because I do think that understanding the depths and ways of doing things on both sides it's necessary to develop scalable, maintainable and robust arquitectures for any system in development where I'm going to participate.
